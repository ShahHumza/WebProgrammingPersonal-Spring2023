As a child, I was fascinated with computers and would often disassemble them to understand their inner workings. This and my passion for video games made me spend more time on the computer. This persuaded and ultimately influenced me to choose a major in Computer Science. I have taken many courses like OOP, Operating Systems, Discrete Algorithms, and more. Nowadays, programming has become such an important and influential aspect of my life. I am always coding and love to spend a lot of time on projects. Recently, I took a software engineering course where I had to make a video game using Unreal Engine. I ended up spending numerous hours on the project and had a lot of fun doing so. The time spent creating the game was a lot of fun and I enjoyed working with a group tremendously. The collaboration aspect changed things completely and, in my eyes, made it many times better. I have also made a simple Personal Portfolio (as you have seen) using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This was a good way for me to test skills and to further develop my skills.

Recently, I have started to apply to, for a lack of better words, A LOT of internships. This has made me realize that in certain aspects, I lack skills that are important. When reading the syllabus, I saw that we were going to learn numerous skills that appeared in job descriptions like Node.js, MongoDB, and React. I can now see that this class will teach me a lot of skills that can and will most likely be used in my career. With that said, I believe that any knowledge is valuable but certain skills can be more useful in certain situations. This is one of those cases where I am going to be a software engineer or even a web developer(in the soon-to-be future), so I need skills closely associated with that.
